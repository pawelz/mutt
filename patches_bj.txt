                              Patches for [1]Mutt
                                       
   My patches have name after the version of mutt that they are made for.
   But they should always be usable with the newest version, too. If not,
   please [2]notify me about the problem, and I will update the patch.
   
Bugfixes

   [3]patch-0.95.3i.bj.keyattach.1.
          Avoid to send out a temporary filename from your box when
          sending a pgp key.
          
New features and other changes in behaviour

   [4]patch-0.95.bj.noquote_hdr_term.1.
          Don't quote the header terminator when replying with headers.
          
   [5]patch-0.95.4.bj.status-time.1.
          You can show the current time in your preferred format in the
          status line with this patch. (A bug which prevented compilation
          of this patch on some systems was fixed on March 14).
          
   [6]patch-0.95.4.bj.my_hdr_subject.3
          Use this patch:
          
          + To execute sendhooks before setting subject to make it
            possible to set the subject in a sendhook. The price is that
            you miss the possibility to let the sendhook depend upon the
            subject.
          + To let "my_hdr Subject" commands be controlled by $hdrs. Now
            $hdrs only controls all other kinds of my_hdr commands.
          + To let sendhooks work in batch mode.
            
          Thank you to [7]Rob Reid for fixing a bug in the second version
          of this patch.
          
   [8]patch-0.95.3.bj.ed_mtime.1.
          When you leave the editor, mutt will check if the edited file's
          modification time have changed to decide if the file has been
          modified. This means that it you are able to modify it in less
          than one second (e.g. by running a script to generate some
          text), Mutt may think that it is unmodified.
          
          This patch solves this problem by seting the time stamp of a
          new file to `one second ago' before calling the editor.
          
   [9]patch-0.94.13.bj.current_shortcut.1
          This patch will make the ^ character a shortcut for the
          currently open mailbox.
          
Optimizations

   [10]patch-0.95.bj.hash_destroy.2.
          This patch will speed up a little bit closing of mailboxes.
